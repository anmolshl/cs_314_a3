Google Chrome is the best option!A3 solution info:- Background changed to a scene still from Witcher 3.- Object colors changed.- Sphere now revolves around the scene, so does light. This gives us a transitioning lighting effect.- Torus now wobbles around scene.- Ground texture changed to grass.- Cones added with same texture as ground to correspond to two hills.- When the scene loads for the first time, mydino lies disassembled at the origin. Pressing ‘u’ assembles it and starts the curved animation.- Pressing ‘v’ reverses the curved animation. This is implemented by reversing the order of avars in the original animation.- Pressing ‘u’ again toggles off the animation and mydino comes to a halt.- Pressing ‘t’ toggles between different meshes that can chase chasing mydino.- Pressing ‘c’+’f’ makes toggled object chase mydino, pressing it again halts the chase.- Pressing ‘l’+’k’ toggles the laser on and off.- Pressing ‘j’ flips mydino. Flipping is possible in all situations except when the animation is toggled off.- Pressing ‘z’ toggles the ‘steer and walk mode’ on and off. Once on, one can use w,a,s,d controls to walk the dinosaur. Aditionally, pressing ‘q’ makes mydino ascend the scene whereas pressing ‘h’ makes mydino descend.- Flipping in the ‘steer and walk mode’ is also possible.- Mydino was created using a guide 3D object, and all matrices were copied to objects in the descending hierarchy. Translations and rotations were made thereafter. This version of mydino consists of a total of 26 parts.End
